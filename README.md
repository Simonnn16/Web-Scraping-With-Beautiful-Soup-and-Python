# Web-Scraping-With-Beautiful-Soup-and-Python
Web Scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.  Beautiful Soup is a pure Python library for extracting structured data from a website. It allows you to parse data from HTML and XML files. It acts as a helper module and interacts with HTML in a similar and better way as to how you would interact with a web page using other available developer tools.
